# `dkj-policy/scripts/` — the shared workflow scripts (mirror for consumers)

This folder is what a **consumer** of this workflow actually runs. It is a **mirror**, not the source:
the canonical copy of every script here lives in [`scripts/`](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/tree/main/) at the root of this
repository, and that is where development and testing happen. The point of the arrangement is that
consumers (life-hub, smartwatchbanden, …) no longer keep a duplicate of these scripts per repo. The
rationale is in [issue #81](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/81).

**The model — mirror, not a move:**
- The **workshop root copy is the canonical, tested source** (`scripts/…` in this repo). CI runs it from
  a bare checkout.
- The copy **here in the plugin is an LF-identical mirror** — that is what a consumer runs, via a skill.
  The workshop itself keeps using its root copy.
- A **drift lint** (`check-plugin-integrity.ps1`, check 8) guards that mirror and source stay equal, and
  the generator `scripts/sync/build-shared-scripts.ps1` updates the mirror. This way the mirror inherits
  the root copy's test coverage without our having to run it live in the workshop (which is impossible:
  the workshop consumes the last-pushed plugin, not your branch).

**Do not edit a file in this folder.** A change lands in the root source first and travels here through
the generator; the lint reports a hand edit as drift.

## The shared set

The registry is `Get-SharedScriptPairs` in
[`scripts/lib/shared-scripts-lib.ps1`](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/blob/main/), and it is the
only place that knows the answer. **This page deliberately states no count of it**, and the root
`scripts/README.md` made the same choice on the same day (#897): a prose tally of a machine-held list is wrong
when typed and wrong again after the next entry. Ask the registry instead — and note the pairs do **not** all
land here, because a script travels to whichever plugin owns the surface that calls it.

| where the mirror lands | why there |
|---|---|
| `dkj-policy` (this folder) | the branch/PR/release way of working, which is what this plugin *is* |
| `dkj-team-shopify` | the store-facing scripts, whose surface belongs to the platform team |
| `dkj-team-alpha` | `sync/check-roster-sync.ps1` and `lib/check-report-lib.ps1` — the roster check belongs to the core team, since the roster does |

*A fourth destination, `workflow-default`, held one pair — `lib/check-report-lib.ps1` again — until
[#886](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/886) removed that plugin on
August 26, 2026.*

**The table below is hand-maintained beside a registry that can be asked, which is the shape that goes
stale** — three times over, so far. Three rows were missing when the count was last checked (August 15,
2026 — `adopt-workflow-folder`, `session-status` and `source-repo-guard-lib`, each registered but never
listed), re-measuring on August 26 found the header, the destination split and the row list all wrong at
once, the split not even naming `dkj-team-shopify` as a destination, and a third re-measurement
([#1486](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/1486), September 6, 2026) found 21
more rows absent — every row from `task/claim-issue.ps1` down through `lib/claim-issue-lib.ps1` in the
table above, now added. `session-status` has since gone the other way: it was removed along with `/lock`
and `/handover` ([#957](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/957), Dave), so its
row went with it.

**There is no fourth, because the table is now gated**
([#1491](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/1491), September 6, 2026). The
`shared-scripts:mirror` markers around it are read by check 32 (`[shared-script-list]`) in
`check-plugin-integrity.ps1`, which holds each row's first cell against the mirrors `Get-SharedScriptPairs`
lands in this folder and reports both directions — a registered script with no row, and a row the registry
no longer mirrors. Registering a pair without writing its row now turns the gate red on the PR that
registers it, where all three misses above were merged green and found months later. **The check reports
rather than writes**, which is the half that has not changed: a row still needs a description and a Skill
answer, and neither is a figure a script could produce on its own.

Not every script here is reached through a skill, and the **Skill** cell says so rather than linking one, so
an absent link is a fact rather than an oversight.

<!-- /shared-scripts:mirror -->

## How the mirror works

1. **Dual-context repo root.** A shared script resolves its repo root as `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` (for a
   consumer running the mirror) or the git root (workshop root / outside a session). This way the same
   file works in both locations and the mirror stays byte-identical.
2. **Repo data stays local.** The script reads its repo-specific bit from the **consumer's root**:
   `scripts/repo-config.ps1` (the seam) and `scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1` (branch/type derivation).
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves only within plugin-owned components, so that injection runs via
   `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`, not via the plugin root.
3. **The consumer invokes via a skill** (`/fold-changelog`) that runs the script with
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/release/…`. A skill is the only docs-confirmed mechanism that both a
   human and Claude can invoke (`bin/` is only on the Bash tool's PATH and is not directly invokable by
   a human).

To add a script to the shared set: register the pair (source → mirror) in
`scripts/lib/shared-scripts-lib.ps1`, run `scripts/sync/build-shared-scripts.ps1`, and add a skill if
needed.

## What deliberately stays in the consumer's root (cannot move here)

- Everything **CI** invokes from a bare checkout without a plugin cache (the lint gate, the test suites
  and their libs). CI does not see the plugin cache.
- **`branch-info.ps1` cannot move.** It is riveted to the root by two independent callers:
  `release-lib.ps1` dot-sources it (for the branch types, `Get-BranchTypes`) and runs in **CI** from a
  bare checkout — and the root scripts dot-source it. As long as `release-lib` depends on `branch-info`,
  moving it would break the CI gate.
- **`repo-config.ps1`** is by definition repo data (repo name, blob URL, the release seam) and belongs
  locally per repo. The `specialists-init` bootstrap places `repo-config.ps1` + `branch-info.ps1` as a
  `VUL-IN` scaffold, so that a clean consumer does not crash the shared skills on a missing file; the
  scripts moreover pre-flight on it
  ([#86](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/86)).

## Precedent

The plugin runs `hooks/connector-sessioncheck.ps1` via `hooks/hooks.json` with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in
every repo that enables **this** plugin, without registration in the consumer's `settings.json`. (It ran
in every consumer until August 8, 2026, when it moved out of the core team along with the rest of this
way of working — see the [connectors README](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/blob/main/).)
That hook mechanism is proven; the shared-scripts mirror + skill above extends that same SSOT principle
to standalone-invokable workflow scripts.
