.SYNOPSIS
    Integrity check for the claude-code-specialists marketplace: validates the manifests, the
    agent-def frontmatter and the internal links before a change lands via a PR on main.
.DESCRIPTION
    This repo's lint gate (invoked by scripts/release/open-pr.ps1). Read-only -- changes nothing.
    Checks the following; every finding is an error:

      1. .claude-plugin/marketplace.json: valid JSON; every plugins[].source points to an
         existing folder with a .claude-plugin/plugin.json.
      2. every <plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json: valid JSON with a non-empty 'name'.
      3. every <plugin>/agents/*.md: frontmatter contains 'name:', 'id:' and 'group:'.
      3b. every <plugin>/manuals/*-manual.md: frontmatter contains 'id:' and 'group:', and the
         file name <group>-<id>-manual.md matches that frontmatter (the portable manual that the
         corresponding agent def reads in via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/manuals/).
      3c. every <plugin>/personas/*-persona.md: frontmatter contains 'id:' and 'group:', and the
         file name <group>-<id>-persona.md matches that frontmatter. Personas (orchestrator +
         main-loop specialists) DELIBERATELY have no agent def -- they run in the main loop, not
         as a subagent -- so check 6 never demands one of them. It does read them in one direction:
         a persona MAY back a manual of the same id (6b), and then has to name it.
      4. dead relative links AND broken anchors in every ROOT *.md (README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CLAUDE.md,
         CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, INSTALL.md, UNINSTALL.md and any unfolded changelog entry file
         -- globbed, never named), every .claude/extensions/*.md, every <plugin>/skills/*/SKILL.md, every
         <plugin>/manuals/*-manual.md, every <plugin>/personas/*-persona.md, every releases/**/*.md,
         every <plugin>/RELEASE.md, connectors/README.md, and
         every plugin's own plugins/<plugin>/CHANGELOG.md (#103).
         Checked: (a) the linked
         file exists, and (b) if the link
         has a #anchor, that anchor exists as a heading in the target file (GitHub slug rules).
         External http(s)/mailto links are skipped.
      5. every scripts/**/*.ps1 parses without error (catches syntax errors in the orchestration
         itself, which would otherwise only break at execution time).
      6. specialists-system integrity: per plugin, every '<group>-<id>' is unique across the
         agent defs, every agent def has a valid 'name:' + a corresponding manuals/<g>-<id>-manual.md
         which it also names, and conversely every manual is backed by an agent def OR a persona of
         the same id (no orphan manual) -- a persona-backed manual must be named by that persona.
      7. shared agent-def blocks: every <!-- BEGIN/END shared:NAME --> region in an agent def still
         equals its canonical source in dkj-teams/agent-shared/<name>.md (see scripts/agents/build-agent-defs.ps1)
         -- a hand-edit inside the sentinels or a forgotten rebuild is thus caught at the gate.
      8. shared workflow scripts: every plugin mirror of a repo-agnostic script (issue #81) is
         still LF-identical to its root source -- a hand-edit in the mirror or a forgotten
         scripts/sync/build-shared-scripts.ps1 is thus caught at the gate.
      9. RELEASE.md per plugin (Model A, plugin-carried): every plugin folder has a RELEASE.md, and
         the 'vX.Y.Z' it contains equals the 'version' in that plugin's plugin.json. Only
         cut-release.ps1 changes both files together, so an ordinary feature PR can never trip this
         -- a mismatch/missing file means the card was not (re)generated.
     10. marked "all skills" enumerations: an opt-in <!-- skills:all --> ... <!-- /skills:all -->
         span (character-based, so it also wraps inline running prose, not just a bullet list on
         its own lines; scanned in every file from check 4's $linkFiles, with fenced ```-code blocks
         masked out first so a literal example of the marker syntax in a fence is not itself read as
         a live marker) must contain the exact set of backtick-quoted names -- no more, no fewer --
         against the canonical skillset read from every <plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md 'name:'
         frontmatter across ALL plugin folders (not just 'specialists'). A BEGIN without a matching
         END, an END without a matching BEGIN, AND a stray extra END inside an already-open span
         (e.g. a pasted-in duplicate '/skills:all') are all hard errors -- symmetric in both
         directions, EXCEPT when a marker sits inside a fenced example (masked out before matching,
         so it is never seen at all, paired or not). Deliberately opt-in (no generic prose scan): a
         doc with zero spans passes without warning.
     11. printed lifecycle commands: every 'claude plugin install|update|uninstall' that carries an
         @-target (i.e. is an instruction someone RUNS, not prose discussing the command) must carry
         '--scope project' -- or, for 'uninstall' only, '--scope local' (inbound #315: that is the only
         command that removes a record a session start left at local scope). install/update must have
         'claude plugin marketplace update' or a link
         to 'staying-up-to-date' within 12 lines above or 6 below. Both flags fail SILENTLY when
         missing -- a scopeless install writes a machine-wide record and reports success (#274/#279),
         a stale cache serves the previous version and reports success (#282/#284) -- which is why
         three adoption rounds in a row found this same class of doc defect. The @-target is what
         makes a generic scan viable here where check 10 had to be opt-in: measured 11 targeted
         instructions against 13 bare mentions. History is excluded permanently and on purpose
         (CHANGELOG.md root + per-plugin, releases/**, RELEASE.md, root entry files): it records what
         was true then and is never rewritten. The unit is the enclosing inline-code span (a printed
         command wraps across lines), computed over check 10's fence-masked text so a ```-fence
         cannot throw off backtick pairing; inside a fence the unit is the physical line.
     12. printed install-record queries: a fenced block that READS installed_plugins.json in code (names
         the file and parses it) must select 'projectPath', 'scope', 'version' AND 'gitCommitSha'. This is
         the class behind all three findings of adoption round v8 rather than any one of them: the query
         every document points a reader at could not distinguish the release from main after it (#313),
         one record from two (#315), or 'project' from 'local' (#314) -- so it printed a green that
         under-determined the state it claimed to prove. projectPath is required rather than assumed: a
         query without it reports records beyond this repo, which is the 'claude plugin list' mistake
         these same docs warn against. A fenced JSON snippet illustrating the file's shape is NOT a
         subject (it names the fields but is not a command anyone reads a verdict off) -- the same
         mention-versus-use discriminator check 11 makes with its @-target. Shares check 11's scan set,
         so history is excluded identically. Matching is case-insensitive, since PowerShell property
         access is and a working query must not be reported as broken.

     13. entry-heading levels: an entry is an H3 with two named H4 sections, and a body heading may be
         neither. At or above the entry's own level it becomes a SEPARATE entry the moment the fold pastes
         it into CHANGELOG.md -- one declaring no impact, so filed as an undeclared tier 0 -- or, at H1,
         climbs above every entry in the document (seen in v2.13.2). At the SECTION level it truncates the
         section it lands in, and if it is a misspelling of a real section heading the entry silently loses
         that declaration and the tier/significance gates read nothing. Every level comes from
         entry-scaffold-lib.ps1 rather than being written out here. Judged in every unfolded root entry
         file (line 1 skipped, so a pre-format H3 entry still passes) and in CHANGELOG.md below its intro,
         where the intro/entries boundary is derived structurally exactly as Split-Changelog derives it.
     14. encoding: scripts/maintenance/fix-mojibake.ps1 -Check is run as the gate. WHICH files it walks
         is repo-owned since issue #413 -- Get-MojibakePaths in scripts/repo-config.ps1 names them, here
         every *.md in the root, every *.md under plugins/, and every note under releases/. A UTF-8
         character read as ANSI and written back changes the text with no error -- and in an entry
         heading the separator IS the field delimiter, so cut-release.ps1 stops being able to read the
         entry type.
     15. unbound output samples: a fenced block with no language (or 'text') is something the reader
         COMPARES against, so something near it must say what the capture is bound to -- a version, a
         date, a platform, a repo state, or a hedge. Four of test round v11's nine findings were this
         one shape. Blocks tagged powershell/json/jsonc are commands to RUN and are left alone; so are
         blocks containing box drawing, which are drawn rather than captured.
     16. measured figures in prose: check 15's subject one step outside a fence -- a byte count or file
         size in the consumer-facing docs is a measurement of somebody's machine, and the surrounding
         paragraphs must say whose (round v12 filed exactly this as #374).
     17. per-plugin CHANGELOG intro: the header above each plugins/<plugin>/CHANGELOG.md's first
         '## vX.Y.Z' heading must still match what Build-PluginChangelogIntro (scripts/lib/release-lib.ps1)
         generates, with the marketplace name read from marketplace.json. cut-release.ps1 writes that
         header ONLY for a CHANGELOG that does not exist yet, so it is never refreshed -- which is how all
         four files kept naming the retired marketplace after the rename swept it out of 59 others.
         Compared whitespace-normalized (content, not line wrapping); everything below the first version
         heading is history and deliberately not examined, as in checks 11 and 12.
     18. shared-script parameters vs. their skill: every parameter of a mirrored entry point must be named
         in the skill that documents it (the mapping lives in the shared-scripts registry, beside the
         registration). A consumer has only the mirror and its page, so a parameter the page never names
         does not exist for them -- including the escape valve they need when something goes wrong. This is
         a repair: the fold skill told consumers to commit by hand for two days after the script gained
         -Commit/-Push, and four more were found the same way, -Bump and -NoPush among them. Parameters are
         read via the PowerShell parser (a regex missed an attributed one). Per-script exemptions are
         declared in the registry; an entry point declaring no skill at all is reported in the coverage
         line rather than as an error, since writing a missing skill is separate work.
     19. the consumer-facing document set: a document named in that list but absent from the tree is
         reported instead of skipped, because checks 15 and 16 walk the same list and a missing entry
         lowers their coverage silently.
     20. a claimed entry-section COUNT vs. what the scaffolder writes, so prose describing the changelog
         entry cannot drift from the shape a branch actually gets. The rule is the count and not the
         section names, chosen by measuring four candidates. (20b) CHANGELOG.md's intro gets its own pass
         with the level marker optional: the entries below it are history, but the intro is a live
         statement that every cut copies through verbatim, so nothing else ever reads it.
     21. the shipped config blueprint, held by REGENERATING it from this repo's own libs and comparing.
         Nothing here reads the artefact, which is exactly why it needs a gate.
     22. a runnable command in a shipped SKILL.md must not name an absolute path. The page tells a
         consumer what to run, so the path has to resolve on their machine: '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...'
         does, 'C:/Users/<the author>/...' does not. Measured after adopt-config's page shipped with both
         of its commands pointing at the author's own plugin cache, pinned to a version. The subject is
         the '-File' argument rather than paths in general, because a tree-wide rule would be born
         accusing three correct comments that quote a user path to explain a path-mangling bug.
     23. a plugin's name says which kind it is, and where that name claims a directory it must sit
         there: 'team-*' under plugins/dkj-teams/, and '*-policy' / '*-policy-*' under plugins/dkj-policy/.
         'workflow-*', 'contributing-*' and '*-codex' are accepted names held to no directory since
         #1467, because plugins/workflows/ -- which used to name their kind -- is gone. Every plugin is
         still one or the other BY NAME. The directory rule is DERIVED from the
         name, so a plugin matching none of those has its location held against nothing -- an
         unclassifiable name switches the check off for itself rather than merely reading untidily.
         (Until #886 the reason was the core's workflow-sessioncheck counting by the 'workflow-'
         prefix; that hook was retired with workflow-default and the argument above is the one that
         survives it.)
     24. the PR template keeps the two promises open-pr makes about it: the shipped reference under
         plugins/dkj-policy/templates/ byte for byte against Get-PrTemplateReference,
         and THIS repo's own .github/pull_request_template.md only to the contract (one placeholder line
         the matcher recognises). Deliberately weaker for the second, which is genuinely repo-owned: a
         byte rule would refuse a correct change the day it grows a section. A heading is no longer part
         of that contract -- see the block at the check for why open-pr stopped needing one.
     25. the consumer document does not send its reader into a tier written for somebody else -- a link
         from releases/consumer/ into the development (tier 0) or internal (tier 1) tree. LINK TARGETS
         only; a tier named in prose is check 4's declined-path territory. Two neighbouring rules (a
         score, a branch name) were measured on the same tree and declined at 4 and 3 findings, all false.
     26. no frontmatter-bearing shipped document carries a byte-order mark, read as BYTES. Every other
         reader here uses ReadAllText, which strips a BOM before any regex sees it, so a BOM is invisible
         to this gate AND to any editor a reviewer would open -- the one defect findable by neither.
         Measured: adopt-config/SKILL.md shipped with EF BB BF in 4.1.0 and was the one model-invocable
         skill of eleven missing from the agent's skill listing. The subject is the BOM and NOT "must have
         frontmatter": this repo deliberately tolerates a skill page without a 'name:' line, so demanding
         the block would be this gate inventing a policy the repo declined.
     27. the script layer is pure ASCII -- every .ps1 check 5 parses, held to the rule
         .claude/rules/language-layers.md has stated since August 19, 2026 and nothing enforced. Windows
         PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less .ps1 as the system ANSI code page, so a literal non-ASCII
         character decodes as two CP1252 characters, silently, and reaches whatever the script EMITS --
         measured on a middot in entry-scaffold-lib.ps1 that came out wrong in every generated changelog
         template. Check 14 sees that damage one layer downstream, in the generated markdown; this sees
         the literal upstream. A BOM is deliberately NOT a finding: on a .ps1 it is the fix.
     28. every '@'-import target resolves. A dead markdown link costs a reader one click; a dead import
         costs the SESSION THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, because Claude Code drops one it cannot resolve without
         erroring. Reuses measure-context-lib's own parser rather than restating its three resolution
         rules. (Listed here from August 26, 2026 -- the check shipped without its line in this list.)
     29. a plugin's OWN skill enumeration: an opt-in <!-- skills:plugin --> ... <!-- /skills:plugin -->
         span, held against the skills/ of the plugin the DOCUMENT ITSELF sits in (resolved from its
         path, not named in the marker). The two ways it is not check 10: the canonical set is that one
         plugin's rather than the marketplace's, and a claim is a LINK TARGET resolving to
         skills/<one>/SKILL.md rather than any backtick-quoted token -- so a two-column table with prose
         and backticked paths in the second column needs no rewriting to be markable. Opt-in for the
         reason check 10 is: measured over all four plugins, a generic version yields 8 findings on two
         documents that never claimed to enumerate anything.

     30. printed instructions naming a model-barred skill: a printed message must not tell its reader to
         "run the X skill" when X's frontmatter carries 'disable-model-invocation: true'. That flag removes
         the page from the model's context entirely, so a session cannot follow the instruction -- and the
         reader who CAN, the person at the keyboard, is never told the line is theirs to type. The correct
         form names the slash-command and the actor, or names the script. FRONTMATTER-DRIVEN, not a
         phrasing rule: check-script-contract names the UNFLAGGED 'adopt-dkj-policy' with the same
         bare imperative and is correct to, so a grep for the wording would be born with a false finding.
         The discriminator is the word 'skill' after the name, measured: without it 8 unique sites of which
         4 are wrong (three name the SCRIPT, one is prose offering a choice); with it 11 hits over 7 sites,
         all 7 correct. Both layers are scanned, also measured -- printed output carries 6 of the 7 and
         INSTALL.md the seventh, so output-only would have passed over the one a consumer reads. Printed
         means a string argument to a writer cmdlet, found through the PARSER, so a comment about the rule
         is not a subject. Markdown reuses CHECK 11's file set and its fence masking, and both matter here:
         history (CHANGELOG.md, releases/**, RELEASE.md) records the old wording and is never rewritten, the
         branch document's text is pasted into CHANGELOG.md at the fold, and a FENCED example is an
         illustration rather than an instruction. Found the hard way -- the branch introducing this check
         quotes the forbidden wording to explain it, and the gate refused to push it. The class bit twice a
         month apart with nothing connecting them (#731 -> #734, then #1093/#1096 rediscovered from scratch
         when a consumer adoption stopped on it), which is what turned it from a risk into the finding
         filed as #1104.

    Exit code: 0 = no errors. 1 = at least one error (usable as a gate in open-pr.ps1).
.PARAMETER SkipCheck
    (Optional) coverage categories NOT to run, e.g. -SkipCheck parse,branch-template. FOR THIS GATE'S
    OWN TEST SUITES, and for nothing else: no gate -- open-pr, cut-release, CI -- passes it, and a guard
    test holds them to that.

    WHY IT EXISTS, MEASURED. The four check-plugin-integrity-*.tests.ps1 suites run this script 168 times
    over a fixture -- 52 + 45 + 40 + 31 -- each run a fresh process executing all 30 checks in order to
    assert one. As ONE suite that was 194s, of which 98% was inside those child runs, and it was the test
    gate's whole wall clock -- three times the next slowest suite, so the gate cost what this one suite
    cost. Profiled over the fixture at the time, three checks were reported as half of every run:
    agent-def, parse and branch-template, none of which most scenarios are about.

    THE SKIP CAME FIRST AND THE SPLIT SECOND, and both were needed. Skipping took the suite from 194s to
    ~160s; splitting it into four files (August 16, 2026, issue #714) took the runs from 160s in one lane
    to ~51s across four ON A WORKSTATION, because the test gate parallelises per FILE. Neither removed a
    scenario.

    THE SKIP'S OWN SAVING IS NOW 2.0%, re-measured September 3, 2026 (issue #1358): 1.362s against 1.390s
    over today's fixture. The three checks are not half of anything in it -- it carries 2 skills, no
    manuals and no personas, so they have almost nothing to walk there. The counts above were 110 and 27
    until the same re-measurement. Do not reach for this parameter for speed; it buys 2% and it is the one
    knob here that can make an absence assert pass vacuously. The fixture's own header records what
    actually dominates an invocation, and check-plugin-integrity-fixture.ps1 is where that measurement
    lives.

    A SKIPPED CHECK IS NEVER REPORTED AS 'checked 0'. This gate deliberately makes an empty scan visible
    -- 'no agent def found' is a finding-shaped statement, because a check that examined nothing must not
    read as a check that passed. A skip therefore prints its own [SKIP] line and no coverage line at all,
    so the two states cannot be confused by a reader or by an assert.

    An unknown category is a hard error rather than a no-op, because the failure mode this parameter
    introduces is silence: a scenario that skips 'agentdef' would run the check it meant to skip, and a
    scenario asserting the ABSENCE of a finding from a check it accidentally skipped would pass while
    testing nothing.

# plugins/ only for CHANGELOG.md, SKILL.md, manuals and personas -- so a document sitting directly in
# plugins/ matched NO rule and left the scan set without a word. Measured on the move: all three went dark
# at once, every one of their own outbound links unvalidated, while the run still reported clean. That is
# the omission this file's root glob exists to prevent, arriving through the other side. Non-recursive on
# purpose, exactly as above: every subdirectory is gathered by its own rule below.
#
# GUARDED BY Test-Path, unlike the root glob, because $RepoRoot always exists and plugins/ does not: a
# consumer has no plugins/ at all, and neither does a lint fixture that never creates one. Without the
# guard Get-ChildItem raises ItemNotFound there -- which is how the first version of this line broke the
# test suite in a place that had nothing to do with links.
#
# RECURSIVE SINCE AUGUST 10, 2026, AND THAT ENDS THE CLASS RATHER THAN PATCHING IT (inbound #566). This
# glob was non-recursive with the comment "every subdirectory is gathered by its own rule below" -- true of
# agent defs, skills, manuals, personas and the plugin CHANGELOGs, and false of anything else. A markdown
# file at PLUGIN level matched no rule at all, which is where a plugin's own README.md sits: the first page
# a consumer reads, its links never once validated. Measured on the day this was widened: six such files,
# five of them already in the tree (plugins\dkj-teams\README.md, plugins\workflows\README.md -- the latter
# merged into the plugin's own page by #1467 -- both workflow
# plugin READMEs, and dkj-policy\scripts\README.md) and the sixth the portable contribution guide
# added by that same change -- a consumer-facing page whose whole purpose is to be copied, and whose dead
# links would therefore be copied with it. All six were clean, so this arrives green; the point is that
# nothing would have said otherwise.
#
# THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE SAME OMISSION HAS BEEN WRITTEN UP in this block -- the family glob, then

# has". A shape-by-shape list keeps losing that race, so plugins/ is now read whole: every markdown under it
# is payload, and payload gets its links read. The rules below that also reach in here are left exactly as
# they are, because each one covers paths OUTSIDE plugins/ too; their overlap is removed by the dedupe at
# the end of this set rather than by trimming them back.

# set, no longer by a rule of their own -- but WHY they must be in it is worth keeping, because the glob
# does not say it. Added to close the window in #234: the gap was structural rather than subtle, since an
# entry file's text lives outside every scanned path while the PR is open and only enters a scanned file
# at FOLD time -- which happens directly on main, past every PR gate. So the sequence was: CI green on the
# PR (text in an unscanned file) -> the fold introduces the error on main -> nothing reviews the fold,
# because it is one of the sanctioned direct-on-main actions -> the next full gate run is
# cut-release.ps1, which refuses to release. That is how v2.13.0 was blocked by a changelog sentence.
#
# Scanning them means the PR gate sees exactly the text the fold will paste into CHANGELOG.md, so the
# error surfaces where it can still be reviewed. Their links are validated at ROOT position, which is
# correct twice over: the entry file sits in the root, and CHANGELOG.md -- where it is headed -- is in the
# root too, so a relative link that resolves here resolves there. Checks 11 and 12 exclude them again by
# name, since an entry file is history in the making (see $lifecycleFiles below).

# and check 10 is precisely what #234 tripped over.

# DEDUPED ONCE, HERE, so that widening a rule above never has to be weighed against double-reporting.
# The rules in this set are deliberately overlapping: several name a SHAPE of file wherever it sits (SKILL.md,
# *-manual.md, */agents/*.md) while others name a PLACE and take everything in it (the root, plugins/,
# branch/, releases/). Under the previous shape-by-shape arrangement the two kinds happened not to collide,
# and that coincidence was load-bearing -- the plugins/ glob carried a comment justifying non-recursion by
# it. It is not load-bearing any more: a file gathered twice is scanned twice, every finding in it reported
# twice, and the coverage line would overcount the set. First occurrence wins, so the order the rules run in
# still decides nothing.

# WHERE THIS REPO'S CHANGELOG ACTUALLY LIVES, resolved once for the four checks that need to name it: the
# entry's LINK BASE in check 4 just below, the lifecycle-command exclusion (check 11), the entry-heading
# pass (check 19) and the shape-claim pass (check 20b). All of them said the literal 'CHANGELOG.md' until
# August 27, 2026, when the file moved into contributing-davekjohn/ and this repo answered
# Get-ChangelogPath to say so. A gate that keeps naming the old path does not fail loudly -- it silently
# judges a file that is not there, which is the quietest way for a check to stop checking.
#
# IT IS RESOLVED HERE, ABOVE THE LINK SCAN, RATHER THAN 500 LINES DOWN WHERE IT USED TO SIT (issue #1041).
# Check 4 needs it to answer where an entry's links resolve from, and check 4 runs first -- so the value
# has to exist before the loop rather than in front of its first other consumer.
#
# DOT-SOURCED IN A SCRIPTBLOCK, the idiom check 16 established and for its reason: repo-config is not
# loaded in this process anywhere else, and pulling two dozen repo functions into the whole lint to serve
# four checks is how a gate acquires a dependency nobody meant to give it.
#
# READ THE SAME WAY THE FOLD READS IT -- Get-SeamValue over Get-DefaultChangelogPath -- rather than with a
# literal fallback of its own. A gate whose idea of "the changelog" can differ from the fold's is a gate
# that passes a document nobody writes and never sees the one that is written.
#
# THIS ADDS seam-lib.ps1 TO THE GATE'S DEPENDENCIES, which the lint fixture has to copy alongside the
# other libs. That is stated here because the failure is loud but misleading: the dot-source fails inside
# the fixture's own copy of this script, the gate dies before check 4, and four suites report several
# dozen unrelated scenarios as broken -- the same shape the fixture's marketplace list has twice paid for.

    #
    # THE BRANCH DOCUMENT IS THE SECOND CASE OF THE SAME RULE (August 6, 2026). Its DEPLOY section is
    # pasted verbatim into the changelog, so its links have to resolve WHERE THE FOLD WRITES -- and until
    # the branch/ split they did by construction, because the entry file itself sat beside the changelog in
    # the root. Moving it one level down turned every link in an entry into a dead one: measured on the
    # first entry written after the move, with five more of the same shape already pending. Validating it
    # where the file sits would force authors to write '../' links that break the moment they land.
    #
    # THE BASE IS THE CHANGELOG'S OWN DIRECTORY, NOT $RepoRoot (issue #1041, August 28, 2026), and that is
    # the whole of this repair. It was the repo root while the changelog was, and CHANGELOG.md moved into
    # contributing-davekjohn/ on August 27 -- so the special case went on demanding the root form that the
    # fold then breaks. Measured: a DEPLOY link written as '../plugins/...' -- correct for BOTH
    # the branch's development document and the changelog, which now sit in one directory -- was refused as dead, and the form
    # this check accepted resolved from dkj-policy/ after the fold and was dead there. Precisely
    # the failure the paragraph above says this case exists to prevent, running backwards.
    #
    # THE SPECIAL CASE SURVIVES THE REPAIR RATHER THAN BEING DROPPED, which is the part that is not
    # obvious: for TODAY'S name the base now equals the file's own directory, so this branch and the
    # fall-through agree and it looks like dead weight. The LEGACY names do not agree -- they sit in
    # dkj-policy/branch/, one level BELOW the changelog -- and a branch open since before the
    # August 23 merge still carries one. Dropping the case would judge those where they sit, which is the
    # original defect at a smaller radius.
    #
    # READ FROM THE SEAM, not from a literal, for the reason the resolution block above the loop gives:
    # this is the same value the fold and open-pr's link gate resolve, so the three cannot disagree about
    # where an entry's text lands.
    #
    # THE STEP LIST IS DELIBERATELY NOT INCLUDED, though it sits in the same directory. It never travels:
    # it is read where it lies and reset in place, so 'where the file sits' IS its destination, and the
    # ordinary '../' convention every other nested document here follows is the correct one for it.
    # EVERY NAME, because a branch created before the merge still carries the pair and their links resolve
    # from the same place -- see Resolve-BranchFilePath.
    #
    # AND IT IS THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, NOT ONLY ITS DEPLOY SECTION (August 23, 2026). Strictly, the entry's text
    # is what folds; the plan above it stays where it is. One rule for one file is the honest simplification:
    # the head is guidance comments and phase headings, which carry no links at all in the scaffold, and an

# --- 5. PowerShell scripts must parse -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Catches syntax errors before they land on main. The pure logic of a script can be tested
# separately, but a parse error in the orchestration itself would only break at execution time --
# this check pulls that forward, to the PR gate. Scanned: scripts/**/*.ps1 AND everything a plugin
# carries -- <plugin>/skills/**/*.ps1 (e.g. specialists-init's bootstrap), <plugin>/scripts/**/*.ps1
# (the shared SSOT home, issue #81) and, since August 23, 2026, <plugin>/hooks/**/*.ps1. Made unique so
# a path that hits two filters is not parsed twice.
#
# The plugin-scripts half is anchored on the plugins root rather than matched as a path segment (#405).
# 'plugins' is not a distinctive name: it is also the leaf of .claude/plugins/, so a segment match would
# widen this check to anything a consumer's plugin layer happens to carry. The old segment name
# ('claude-code-plugins') was unique enough to get away with it; this one is not.
# THE SET IS GATHERED ONCE AND CACHED, and it stopped being check 5's private business on
# August 23, 2026. Until then the gather sat inside the skip below, on the sound reasoning that
# $psScripts was read by nothing afterwards. Check 27 now reads the same set for a different property
# of the same files, so there are two callers -- and two checks over one set must not each decide for
# themselves what the set IS, which is the second-definition drift this gate exists to catch elsewhere.
#
# CACHED RATHER THAN CALLED TWICE, because the second glob is a -Recurse over the whole repo root. Two
# walks would double the most expensive part of the cheapest check, and the lazy field keeps the
# original saving intact: with both checks off, the walk never happens at all.
#
# THE HOOKS WERE MISSING FROM IT, and that was measured on the same day rather than reasoned about: 158
# .ps1 files are tracked here and this set held 151, the seven absentees being every plugin-carried
# plugins/<kind>/<plugin>/hooks/*.ps1. So a parse error in a SessionStart hook -- the five that speak on
# every session start in this repo among them -- was not seen by this gate at all, and a hook that does
# not parse does not announce itself: the harness reports the failure and the session continues without
# whatever the hook was there to say. They are named in .claude/rules/language-layers.md as part of the
# script layer for exactly that reason, so check 27 below could not have been pointed at that layer while
# they were out. Widening it fixes both checks at once, which is the argument for one set over two.

# THE CommandAst SET PER SCRIPT FILE, PARSED AND WALKED ONCE -- issue #1358. Two non-skippable checks
# want exactly this list over exactly the set above: check 30 (barred-skill) reads the strings printed by
# a writer cmdlet, and shopify-cli looks for a command named 'shopify'. Each used to call ParseFile and
# then FindAll(CommandAst) itself, so every run paid for the same parse and the same full-tree walk twice.
#
# MEASURED, September 3, 2026, over this repo's own 184-file script set: one parse+walk pass is 1.41s, of
# which the WALK is 1.16s and the parse only 0.26s -- so the duplicate that mattered was the walk, not the
# parse the two comments both talked about. A second pass off this cache is 0.014s. Inside the fixture the
# gate's own suites build, the two checks were 216ms and 174ms of a 1315ms invocation; sharing the pass
# removes ~174ms of it, and those suites run this script 168 times.
#
# IT RETAINS THE ASTs, WHICH IS THE COST AND IT IS STATED RATHER THAN DISCOVERED: 25,476 CommandAst nodes
# over that set hold ~72MB of heap and ~100MB of working set. That is affordable on a hosted runner and
# trivial in the fixture (12 files), but it is the reason this caches the CommandAst LIST rather than the
# whole AST per file -- the nodes are reachable from it either way, and a narrower promise is easier to
# keep. If it ever needs to be memory-bounded, the answer is to run both checks in ONE pass over the file
# set rather than to cache: the two loops are independent per file and neither needs a second look.
#
# CHECK 5 ('parse') DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE THIS, and the reason is the one its own comment gives from
# the other direction: it is the only skippable one of the three, and it needs the PARSE ERRORS this
# accessor throws away. So it keeps its own pass, which is what lets these two run when 'parse' is
# skipped -- the property the barred-skill comment already relied on, now stated where the sharing is.
#
# An unparseable file yields an EMPTY list, not $null. Both callers counted such a file as covered and

#       about whether their craft has a playbook worth reading on demand. Until this changed it said
#       both, and the orchestrator paid for it: always loaded, and the one specialist whose every rule
#       had to sit on the always-on path, because the gate refused him the on-demand half the other
#       fifteen have. Where a persona backs a manual it must NAME it, for the same reason 6a makes an
#       agent def name its own -- nothing else would ever read it. A persona with no manual is the
#       normal case and is asserted about in neither direction.

# --- 10. marked "all skills" enumerations vs. the canonical skillset -----------------------------------
# A prose bullet list that claims to enumerate "all skills" is a maintenance trap: it silently
# drifts as skills are added/removed, and a generic prose scan over-detects (tested and rejected --
# 147 hits repo-wide, including INSTALL.md's deliberately incomplete illustrative list, which
# would permanently false-positive). Instead this is opt-in: an author wraps the enumeration in
#     <!-- skills:all -->
#     - `skill-name`
#     ...
#     <!-- /skills:all -->
# and only spans between those sentinels are checked -- a doc with zero spans passes silently
# (that absence of warning is deliberate, not an oversight). Reuses check 4's $linkFiles set
# rather than its own file list (single source for "which docs matter").
#
# Extraction is CHARACTER-based (offset of the end of the BEGIN match to the start of the END
# match), not line-based. The real-world enumerations this exists for (e.g. the root README's
# "only the skills (...) remain available there" sentence) are inline running prose, not a bullet
# list on its own lines -- a line-based span could only mark that by putting a sentinel on its own
# line mid-paragraph, which breaks the paragraph in rendered markdown (an HTML comment is an HTML
# block that interrupts a paragraph). Character-based extraction lets the author wrap the sentinels
# tightly around just the enumeration itself, inline, e.g. `(...skills <!-- skills:all -->(`a`,
# `b`)<!-- /skills:all --> remain...`, with the same code path serving both the inline form and a
# block bullet-list form. AUTHOR CONDITION, because of this: every backtick-quoted token anywhere
# inside the span counts as a claimed name -- so the span must be wrapped tightly enough to contain
# ONLY skill names, nothing else in backticks (e.g. NOT the three SessionStart hook names in that
# same README sentence, which sit outside the parenthesized skill list and so outside the span).
#
# A literal example of the marker syntax in a doc (e.g. Tessa's convention writeup) must NOT be
# read as a live marker itself -- otherwise the syntax could only ever be described, never shown.
# Get-FenceMaskedText below masks fenced ```-code blocks with same-length whitespace before the
# BEGIN/END scan runs, so an example fence is invisible to it (an unpaired BEGIN inside a fence is
# therefore also invisible -- not reported, because the scan never sees it at all, not because it
# is special-cased). Deliberately fences only, not inline single-backtick code: a real span's own
# claimed names are themselves single-backtick-delimited (the `` `skill-name` `` bullets), so
# masking every inline-code run would erase the very names a real span exists to list -- there is
# no way to tell "backtick pair is an inline-code escape" from "backtick pair is a claimed skill
# name" at the character level. A fence is therefore the ONLY supported way to show the bare marker
# text without it being read as live; showing it in inline code is not an escape and stays in scope
# (Tessa documents the fence form as the convention, not inline code).
function Get-FenceMaskedText {
    # Masks fenced ```-code blocks with SAME-LENGTH whitespace (newlines untouched), so the caller

    # inside a fence become spaces. Uses the SAME fence-toggle detection (Test-FenceDelimiterLine,
    # flip a boolean per line) that Get-HeadingSlugs already uses above -- one shared pattern, not
    # two independently hardcoded ones. It cannot reuse Get-HeadingSlugs's RESULT directly, though:

# THE OPT-IN SPAN WALK, ONCE (issue #1491). Three checks now read an author-placed

# computed elsewhere: check 10 (skills:all), check 29 (skills:plugin) and check 32
# (shared-scripts:plugin). Everything about FINDING those spans is identical between them -- the fence
# masking, the forward walk, the three malformed-marker errors and the two symmetric sweeps -- and
# only what happens INSIDE a span differs.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT A THIRD COPY, and the argument is measured in this file rather than
# borrowed: checks 10 and 29 were the same walk written twice, and they DIVERGED. The nested-BEGIN
# case -- a second opener pasted inside an already-open span, which pairs across the whole span and
# comes out green for the wrong reason -- was reported by neither, was found while walking into it on
# check 29's branch, and had to be repaired in BOTH places on August 26, 2026. Check 10's own comment
# at that fix says so. A third hand-written copy would have been the third place to repair, and the
# one most likely to be missed: it is the copy nobody remembers exists.

# --- 11. printed lifecycle commands carry their flags --------------------------------------------------
# THE CLASS THIS CLOSES. Three adoption rounds in a row (v3, v4, v5) found the same kind of defect and
# nothing else: a doc place printing a command, a count or a step that no longer holds. v3 was the
# adoption path plus three reporting errors, v4 was inbound #279 + #280, v5 was all four of its findings
# -- and three of the five repairs in 3.0.3 were of that kind too. Four doc fixes close four instances;
# the instances came back every round. This closes the half of the class a regex can actually decide:
# a printed `claude plugin install|update|uninstall` must carry `--scope project`, and install/update
# must have the marketplace refresh named nearby. Both are things a reader COPIES, and both fail
# silently when wrong -- a scopeless install writes a machine-wide record with no projectPath and
# reports success (inbound #274/#279), a stale cache reports success with a plausible version number
# (inbound #282/#284).
#
# THE TWO RULES REST ON DIFFERENT FOOTING, AND THE COMMENT SAYS SO RATHER THAN FLATTENING IT. The scope
# rule and the refresh-next-to-INSTALL rule each rest on a measured silent failure. The
# refresh-next-to-UPDATE half does not: measured 2026-07-31 (CLI 2.1.220) right after v3.0.4, with the
# cached clone verifiably still on the pre-release commit, a bare project-scoped update moved
# 3.0.3 -> 3.0.4 AND advanced the clone itself during the run -- so `update` refreshed for itself, and
# the older claim that skipping the refresh makes an update serve the previous version did not survive
# testing. The rule is kept anyway (Dave, 2026-07-31): the refresh is idempotent, it is one command, and
# a stale cache is invisible by construction, so the docs should keep naming it. What changed is the
# wording -- prudence, not a mechanism claim. Keeping that distinction visible here is the point: this
# check exists because doc claims drifted from measured reality, and it must not become an instance of
# that itself.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR, and it is the whole reason this can be a generic scan where check 10 could not be.
# A command with an explicit @-TARGET is an instruction someone runs:
#     claude plugin install dkj-team-alpha@claude-code-specialists --scope project
#     claude plugin update <plugin>@<marketplace> --scope project
# A BARE mention is prose discussing the command, and demanding flags there would be nonsense:
#     "`claude plugin update` has the same default", "Because `claude plugin update` pins the cache"
# Measured over the scan set before this check was written: 10 targeted, 13 bare. That separation is
# what keeps this from becoming the 147-hit over-detection that made check 10 opt-in instead.
#
# HISTORY IS EXCLUDED, deliberately and permanently: CHANGELOG.md (root and per-plugin), releases/**,
# every RELEASE.md card, and the root changelog ENTRY files. Those record what was true at the time and
# are never rewritten -- the same principle the teardown's own audit applies when it excludes history
# from its scan. specialists/CHANGELOG.md:162 proves the need: it prints a targeted install with no
# scope flag, correctly, because that is what the release it describes actually said.
#
# SPANS, NOT LINES. A printed command wraps across a newline in running prose -- the teardown SKILL's
# `claude plugin uninstall <plugin>@<marketplace>` carries its `--scope project` on the NEXT line, inside
# the same inline-code span. A line-based check calls that a violation (it did, on the first probe run).
# So the unit is the enclosing inline-code span where there is one, and the rest of the physical line
# otherwise (which is the right unit inside a fenced block, where one command is one line).
#
# And the spans are computed over the FENCE-MASKED text, reusing check 10's Get-FenceMaskedText. Without
# that, a ```-fence delimiter throws off backtick pairing for the whole rest of the file: the regex
# cannot start a span on the first two backticks of a ``` run, starts one on the third, and closes it on
# the first backtick of the CLOSING fence -- after which every real inline span downstream is paired one
# position out. That is what made the wrapped uninstall above look flagless on the second run, and it is
# a silent misread rather than an error, so it is worth naming here. Masking keeps offsets and newline
# positions identical, so a span found in the mask indexes straight back into the real text.
#
# PRESENCE, NOT ORDER. The refresh window reaches 12 lines back and 6 forward, so a doc that names the
# refresh in the sentence just below the block still passes. Whether the refresh is described BEFORE the
# install in reading order is a judgement about prose, not something this regex should pretend to make;
# the check guarantees the step is named in the same instruction context, and a reviewer judges the rest.
# THE SCOPE RULE IS VERB-SPECIFIC, and `uninstall` is the exception rather than a loophole in it. For
# `install`/`update`, `project` is the only correct value and the rule rests on a measured silent failure
# (#274/#279). For `uninstall` it does not: a record sitting at `scope=local` is what a SESSION START
# leaves behind -- enabling a plugin is enough for one to create a record, and to flip an existing
# `project` record to `local`, with no command run (inbound #314) -- and `claude plugin uninstall ...
# --scope project` REFUSES to remove such a record ("Plugin ... is installed in local scope, not
# project", inbound #315). Demanding `project` on every printed uninstall would therefore make this gate
# reject the only command that does the job, i.e. it would enforce the very assumption round v8 disproved:
# that `project` is the only scope a consumer can be in. So `uninstall` accepts `project` OR `local`, and
# the other two verbs keep the stricter rule. Widening this to install/update would be wrong: nothing
# measured says a `local` install is ever what a reader wants.

# --- Check 12: a printed install-record query must name the fields that disambiguate the state -----
# THE CLASS, and why this is a gate rather than three doc fixes. Round v8 produced three findings that
# read as unrelated and are one: the family's own verification query -- the thing every document points a
# reader at to answer "what am I actually running?" -- printed a green that UNDER-DETERMINED the state it
# claimed to prove. It could not distinguish
#   - the release from `main` after it            (#313: `version` reads 3.0.8 on both; only gitCommitSha
#                                                  differs, and that field was printed nowhere),
#   - one record from two                         (#315: the prescribed repair install ADDS a record, and
#                                                  the line count was the only signal),
#   - `project` from `local`                      (#314: which is what a session start leaves behind).
# Three instances closed by three doc edits would have been the fourth adoption round in a row to close
# instances of a class that came back. This closes the half a regex can decide: whether the query a doc
# PRINTS still selects every field a reader needs to tell those states apart. Sibling of check 11 in
# footing and in shape -- both hold a copied instruction to what was measured rather than to itself -- and
# it shares check 11's scan set, so history is excluded here for the same reason.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR: the block must READ the administration IN CODE (it names installed_plugins.json and
# parses it). That is what separates an instruction someone copies from a doc merely discussing the file --
# the same mention-versus-use question check 11 answers with the @-target, and the third time this repo has
# had to answer it (see the MENTION vs USE rule in Sylvester's lens). A JSON snippet ILLUSTRATING a record
# is therefore out of scope even though it names the same fields: it teaches the file's shape, it is not a
# command whose output someone reads a verdict off.
#
# projectPath IS ONE OF THE REQUIRED FIELDS, not part of the discriminator, and that is deliberate: a query
# that reads the administration WITHOUT filtering on projectPath is exactly the `claude plugin list` mistake
# both documents spend a paragraph warning about -- it reports records beyond this repo and so cannot carry
# a verdict about this one. A doc printing that would be reproducing the very defect it warns against.
#
# Matching is case-INSENSITIVE on purpose. The reader copies these to run them, and PowerShell property
# access is case-insensitive, so `$_.Version` is as correct as `$_.version`; demanding the JSON file's exact
# casing would report a working query as broken. Erring this way can only miss a miscased field, never
# invent a finding -- the same direction check 11 and Get-RecordShape both chose.

# --- 13. entry heading levels: a body heading cannot become an entry, nor a section of one ---------------
# THE DEFECT, and it is this repo's own, four times in one day. An entry body used a sub-heading at the
# entry's own level, so the two became siblings: after the fold, CHANGELOG.md carried headings with no PR
# number, and the release renderer split an entry on every one of them -- emitting extra "entries" with no
# number, no type and no Plugins line. Rendall's lens already warned about it (seen in v2.13.2, where a
# body heading rendered as a release category). The warning did not stop it, which is the argument for a
# gate rather than a sharper sentence: the rule is exactly checkable, so nobody should have to remember it.
#
# EVERY LEVEL IS READ FROM THE FORMAT LIB (entry-scaffold-lib.ps1, via release-lib.ps1), because the levels
# moved on August 5, 2026 and a hardcoded copy would have gone stale exactly the way this file's own
# Test-IsChangelogEntryFile did. An entry heading is an H3; its two named sections are H4.
#
# WHAT IS NOW WRONG, AND WHY EACH HALF IS A REAL DEFECT RATHER THAN A STYLE RULE:
#   - a heading AT OR ABOVE the entry's own level in a body. An H3 becomes a SEPARATE ENTRY -- Split-Changelog
#     splits on exactly that level -- and the phantom carries no impact table, so it reads as an undeclared
#     tier 0 and gets its own block in the record. An H1 climbs above every entry in the document.
#   - a SECTION-LEVEL heading that is not one of the entry's declared sections. This half is new with the
#     format, and it is not cosmetic: Get-EntrySectionBody ends a section at the next heading of that level
#     or above, so a stray H4 truncates whichever section it lands in -- and a MISTYPED section heading
#     ('Who is this For') is the same shape, silently costing the entry the very declaration the tier and
#     significance gates read. Use '##### ' or bold for a sub-heading; fix the spelling for a section.
#
# TWO PLACES, because they catch it at two different moments:
#   - the root ENTRY FILES, which is where the author can still fix it on the PR. Line 1 is the entry's own
#     heading and is skipped whatever its level -- a pre-format H3 entry file is legitimate, and the fold
#     promotes it as it lands.
#   - CHANGELOG.md below its intro, which is what cut-release actually parses. This half also catches damage
#     that arrived through the fold -- the one write that happens directly on main, past every PR gate (the
#     #234 lesson).
# Fence-aware in both, via the same Get-FenceMaskedText the other checks use: an entry that QUOTES a heading
# inside a code fence is discussing structure, not creating it -- the mention-versus-use question this file
# has now answered four times, and this repo's own changelog and entry files do exactly that.

# [entry-heading] on it -- on the one write that happens directly on main, past every PR gate, inside the
# required CI check. Every PR after the first fold would have been blocked by the fold of the one before it.

# THE ENTRY IS IN branch/ SINCE THE SPLIT (August 6, 2026), so scanning only the root would leave this
# check with nothing to judge on every branch -- and it would still report [OK], because "no unfolded entry
# file" is a legitimate state between merges. A check that goes quiet for the right-looking reason is worse
# than one that errors. Both locations are walked, for the same "recognise both" reason the fold walks both.
#
# AND THE ENTRY IS A SECTION OF A DOCUMENT, NOT A DOCUMENT (August 23, 2026). Both branch files used to open
# with an H2, so the structural test -- the only thing that tells an entry from a root doc -- said yes to the
# step list too, and it had to be excluded by PATH. The branch document's own heading sits a level above an
# entry's, so that test now says no to the WHOLE file, which would have quietly dropped every branch entry out of this check rather
# than merely mis-reporting it. The exclusion is gone and the entry is read out of the document instead --
# Split-Development, the same boundary the fold and the two gates use.
#
# WITH ITS LINE OFFSET, because this check prints line numbers. A finding reported against the entry's own
# first line, in a file where the entry starts forty lines down, is a finding the reader cannot find.
#
# The fold needed no such repair: it reaches the document by path and only ever applies the structural test
# to loose *.md in the ROOT, where a step list has never lived.

        #
        #   - an entry with sections: its FIRST declared section must be the first one ('$ehWhatHeading').
        #     A stray heading dropped inside a formatted entry splits the three sections across two blocks,
        #     so the phantom's first section is whichever one followed it -- never the first.
        #   - an entry with NO sections: only a pre-format entry, which carries its type as a heading field
        #     instead. Resolve-EntryType answers that, reading the section where there is one and the heading
        #     where there is not -- the same reader the release documents use, so the gate cannot disagree
        #     with them about what an entry declares.
        #
        # THAT PAIR IS WHAT MAKES IT COMPLETE, and neither half is complete alone. A stray heading placed

# that writes the same shape is TWO SOURCES OF ONE FORMAT, which this repo has paid for repeatedly -- the
# scaffold wording, the fence readers, the tier sections. Before that it held two files under
# branch/templates/ for the same reason.
#
# THERE IS NO TRUNK COPY TO HOLD ANY MORE. The document exists for the lifetime of a branch: new-branch
# creates it, the fold removes it. So the drift this check existed to catch cannot happen -- a hand-edit to
# a reset copy needs a reset copy -- and what is worth asserting instead is the invariant that replaced it:
# NO DOCUMENT ANYWHERE DECLARES THE TRUNK. Absent is the trunk's normal state, a file naming this branch is
# work in progress, and a file naming the trunk is a leftover the fold should have taken.
#
# WHICH IS ALSO THE ONE STATE A CONSUMER CAN REACH BY DOING NOTHING WRONG, and the reason this reports the
# path rather than a shape. A repo updating from an older plugin has a trunk copy the previous fold wrote;
# their next fold removes it. Here, on the repo that owns the format, one should never survive a run.
#
# NO SHAPE IS ASSERTED, deliberately, and that is the cost of the inversion stated out loud. While a reset
# state existed there was one moment when the file was known-empty and could be compared to the formatter;
# a branch's file holds somebody's work and never can be. The scaffold gate and the step-list gate read the

# --- 14. mojibake: a double-encoded character is a silent content change -----------------------------------
# MEASURED HERE, August 1, 2026, and it nearly shipped. Demoting four headings in CHANGELOG.md with
# Get-Content + WriteAllLines mangled 35 separators into 105 double-encoded sequences: Windows PowerShell
# 5.1's Get-Content reads a BOM-less UTF-8 file as ANSI, so a middot (U+00B7, bytes C2 B7) comes back as two
# characters, and writing that back as UTF-8 stores the mangled pair. Nothing errors -- the file stays valid
# UTF-8, it just says something else.
#
# WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A CONVENTION. The middot IS the field delimiter in an entry heading
# ('### #NN <middot> title <middot> type <middot> date'), so cut-release.ps1 could no longer read the entry
# TYPE: eleven entries fell into a catch-all category instead of Features/Fixes/Documentation. It was caught
# by inspecting the generated notes before pushing (-NoPush), i.e. by one person looking carefully at the
# right moment -- which is precisely the thing not to rely on. Third repo to meet this class
# (smartwatchbanden -> life-hub -> here), and life-hub's own tool documents a v2.1.0 release that needed a
# manual fix for the same reason.
#
# The detector is the repair tool itself, run rather than restated: one source for "what does damage look
# like", so what the repair can fix and what the gate can see cannot drift apart.
#
# THAT SHARED SOURCE WAS ONCE SHARED BLINDNESS (August 2, 2026). While the tool worked off a hand-written
# table of known sequences, this gate inherited its coverage exactly -- and the table held only the
# single-layer form of most characters. 517 doubly-encoded runs across four files, three of them inside
# this check's own stated scope, were reported here as "No findings" for as long as they existed, and the
# damage rode into the v3.1.0 release notes and the consumer-facing RELEASE.md card. The tool now peels by
# the inverse operation instead of by enumeration, which is what makes this line an assertion again.

# --- 15. unbound output samples: an expectation that cannot hold everywhere -------------------------------
# THE CLASS TEST ROUND v11 KEPT PRODUCING. Four of its nine findings were one shape: a captured sample
# handed to the reader as a fixed expectation, without saying what the capture was bound to.
#   #358  the bootstrap's 'Done:' line, captured in a repo that already had the script scaffolds, so the
#         third pair was inverted for the fresh repo the section was written for
#   #359  a CLI error string that CLI 2.1.220 no longer emits -- and whose replacement suggests a
#         different command than the procedure
#   #360  a byte baseline that was the LF figure, on a platform where every round measures the CRLF one
#   #361  a sender header the reader was told to look for, which no bootstrapped repo emits
# Individually four documentation fixes. Together a rule nobody was holding: an expectation is only
# checkable if the reader can tell when it does not apply to them.
#
# WHY THIS CAN BE A GATE AT ALL, where "is this prose accurate" cannot. The distinction it needs is
# already in the markup. A fenced block carrying a language (powershell, json, jsonc) is something to
# RUN; a fenced block with no language, or 'text', is something to COMPARE AGAINST -- and only the second
# kind can go stale under the reader. Measured before building: 34 fenced blocks across the two
# consumer-facing documents, of which exactly 4 are the second kind, and those 4 are precisely the
# findings above plus one instance the round missed. A check with a four-item haystack does not need a
# heuristic.
#
# AND IT MUST NOT BECOME A CHECK THAT PASSES BY BEING IGNORED. A fuzzy gate gets an opt-out pasted over
# every finding and then reports green while asserting nothing -- the exact failure mode of the mojibake
# table one check up. So the escape hatch is a visible marker that has to name a reason, and the coverage
# line below reports how many samples were examined rather than how many times the check ran.

# this list would drift the moment a fourth document joins -- which is check 16's own subject arriving in
# its source, so it is one variable shared by both.
# ADOPTION.md joined in #408, which is this comment's own warning arriving: the page renamed out from
# under 'QUICKSTART.md' carries every captured sample and measured figure these two checks exist for,
# and the new short QUICKSTART.md carried almost none. Listing only the old name would have left both
# checks reporting green over the document that actually holds their subject.
#
# THE TWO ARE ONE FILE AGAIN -- INSTALL.md, the short page as its first half -- so the set is
# three entries, not four. Note what the merge did to the failure mode this comment describes: while
# they were separate, naming the wrong one silently halved the coverage. Now there is one page and no
# wrong one to name, which is worth more than the entry it saved.
#

# most here, and this comment predicted exactly why: the captured samples and measured figures these
# two checks exist for -- the bootstrap's closing line, the 4+15+2 counts, the verification snippet --
# travelled WITH the adoption half. Listing only the pages that kept their names would have left both

# CHECK 15'S SUBJECT, ONE STEP OUTSIDE ITS REACH. Check 15 holds captured samples inside fenced blocks,

# running prose, where there is no fence:
#   #374  "never literally clean" -- true of a user-scope declaration, written as true of every reader
#   ---   the same over-generalisation one section down, carrying three byte figures from a single machine
#         (~/.claude/settings.json at 22 bytes) on a profile where that file had never existed
# The figures were accurate when captured. What was missing is the sentence saying whose machine they came
# from, and without it a reader whose own numbers differ cannot tell whether they mis-installed or the page
# is stale. Round v12's step-0 table came back fully clean against a page that said clean was impossible.
#
# WHY THIS ONE IS GATEABLE WHERE "IS THIS PROSE ACCURATE" IS NOT. It does not judge the claim; it judges
# whether a binding is present near a figure whose SHAPE is unambiguous. A byte count or a file size is
# always a measurement of something -- there is no authored, non-measured reason to write "939,860 bytes"
# -- so the haystack needs no heuristic to identify. Measured before building, exactly as check 15 was:
# 9 figures across 8 lines in the three consumer-facing documents. A haystack that small is enumerable, and
# the check was run against it before the rule was written rather than after.
#
# THE WINDOW IS THE PARAGRAPH NEIGHBOURHOOD, NOT A LINE COUNT. A figure in a table row is bound by the
# paragraph introducing the table, which sits an arbitrary number of rows above; a figure in prose is bound
# by its own sentence. Both are "the block this line is in, plus the block either side", so that is the

# --- Check 20: a document claiming how many sections an entry has is held to the scaffolder ---------------
# Numbered 20 and not 19: the consumer-doc guard above carries no numbered header of its own, but the suite
# already calls it check 19, and two checks answering to one number is how a finding gets discussed as the
# wrong one.
# ISSUE #508 MEASURED THE PROBLEM: the entry format is described in about ten hand-maintained places against
# two that cannot drift (the templates, held by check 13b, and the scaffolder itself). Two documents were
# found stale during a sweep that was actively looking, one of them consumer-facing.
#
# THE RULE WAS CHOSEN BY MEASUREMENT, NOT BY REASONING, and three earlier candidates were rejected by it:
#
#   >=2 section NAMES together, one of them retired          -> 6 findings on the tree, ALL SIX FALSE
#   the same, minus units that mark the name as history      -> 3 findings, 2 false
#   fenced skeleton blocks only                              -> 0 findings, but covers 1 of 3 known drifts
#   a claimed section COUNT vs the scaffolder's              -> 4 claims, 3 correct, 1 genuinely stale
#
# The name-matching candidates fail on a collision nobody would predict: 'What does this change do?' and
# 'Type of change' are RETIRED entry sections and, AT THE TIME THIS WAS MEASURED, live headings of
# .github/pull_request_template.md. So a name-matcher accuses two correct documents of being stale for
# describing the PR body accurately -- and a check that is born red with an exemption list is the shape
# this repo was already bitten by (Get-RosterIgnoredIds).
#
# THAT COLLISION IS GONE, AND THE MEASUREMENT STANDS ANYWAY (#538, August 9, 2026). Both headings were
# removed from the PR template that day, so the six false findings are no longer reproducible from the
# tree. The tense above is deliberate rather than tidied away: it names WHEN the count was measured
# against the names, which is the only form in which a superseded measurement is still worth anything.
# Two reasons the conclusion does not move with the collision. First, name-matching lost on more than
# that: it also scored 3 findings with 2 false on the narrowed variant, against 4 claims with 3 correct
# for the count. Second, and structurally, a rule keyed on names is one rename away from silence in
# either direction -- which is precisely what just happened to the collision, and would just as easily
# happen to a match the check depends on. The count is a fact the scaffolder owns and no rename touches.
#
# A COUNT HAS NONE OF THAT. It is a fact the scaffolder owns, stated in a form that cannot mean anything
# else, and both recorded drifts made exactly this claim -- "three named `###` sections" -- while the
# scaffolder had moved to six. So this judges the one thing a document says about the shape that is
# checkable without judging its prose, which is the same line checks 15 and 16 draw.
#
# THE LEVEL MARKER IS REQUIRED IN THE TREE PASS, and that is what keeps the haystack honest across ~200
# files. (The one place it is not required is CHANGELOG.md's intro, a dozen lines with its own pass -- the
# block below states what that costs and why it costs nothing there.) Without it the pattern matches
# "one section apart", "two sections went in the same movement", "one section per tier" -- ordinary prose
# about anything, 18 disagreements of which 17 were noise. Requiring the '###' (backticked or not) between
# the number and the word narrows it to four claims in the whole tree, which is a haystack small enough to
# read by hand -- and it was, before this was written.
#
# History is excluded exactly as checks 11 and 12 exclude it: CHANGELOG.md's ENTRIES and the per-plugin
# copies, the release notes, RELEASE.md, and the branch's own document, which is history in the making.
# dkj-policy/CONTRIBUTING.md is deliberately NOT excluded -- it is a document ABOUT the shape,
# which is precisely this check's subject. Two pages used to carry that role and both are gone into it:
# branch/README.md at the merge on August 23, 2026, and this folder's own CLAUDE.md on August 26 (#886).
# One page now, and the check reaches it the same way.
#
# AND NEITHER IS CHANGELOG.md'S INTRO (August 8, 2026). It went out with the rest of that file on the history
# grounds above, and this repo had already written down why that reasoning does not reach the intro:
# release-lib.ps1 was bitten by it on the per-plugin CHANGELOGs and recorded the lesson one screen above the
# code -- "the entries below the intro were history, the intro was a live statement about the present
# mechanism". A cut empties this document down to that intro and carries it through verbatim, so it is the
# one piece of prose in the repo that no release ever rewrites and no reviewer ever opens. Measured on the
# day this was written: it claimed THREE sections while the scaffolder wrote six, and had done so since
# August 6 -- two days, one release, and a consumer-facing release page in between.
#
# TWO THINGS KEPT IT OUT OF REACH, and repairing either one alone leaves it unchecked:
#
#   1. the file was excluded, so nothing read the intro at all;
#   2. the pattern would have walked past it anyway -- the intro wrote "three named sections" with no '###'
#      in the sentence, and it wrote it ACROSS A LINE BREAK.
#
# So the head is judged by its own pass, with the level marker OPTIONAL, and the matching for both passes
# moves from per-line to whole-text. Both were chosen by measuring rather than by argument:
#
#   strict, per line, over the scanned tree   -> 4 claims   (what this check did)
#   strict, whole text, over the scanned tree -> 4 claims   (identical -- the 3 extra it finds sit in the
#                                                            history this check already excludes)
#   loose, whole text, over the whole tree    -> 50 claims  (the documented noise -- 46 of them)
#   loose, whole text, over the intro alone   -> 1 claim    (the real one, before and after the repair)
#
# The marker therefore keeps earning its place everywhere it was measured to earn it, and nowhere else: it
# guards ~200 files against 46 false hits, while the intro is a dozen lines this repo owns, where relaxing it
# costs nothing and is the whole difference between catching the drift and not. Whole-text matching changes
# nothing about what the tree pass reports -- it only closes the blind spot where a reflowed sentence hides a
# claim, which is a formatting accident no author would think of as a bypass.
# THE WRITTEN COUNT, NOT THE RECOGNISED ONE (August 16, 2026). Get-EntrySectionHeadings answers "which
# heading does key X have" for every key that ever existed, retired ones included, so counting its keys
# would hold a document to a shape the scaffolder stopped producing -- and accuse a correct page of being
# stale. Get-EntryWrittenSectionKeys is the shape a reader actually meets.
#
# AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ THROUGH repo-config, unlike check 16's own generation one screen up. That
# was tried on August 19, 2026, while the audience tier's heading was briefly a third '###' section, and
# reverted with it: the count is a property of the FORMAT rather than of the repo, so pulling two dozen repo
# functions in here to answer it would be a dependency bought for nothing.

# --- 22. a skill's own command must not point at the author's disk ----------------------------------------

# runs, which is why the other pages already use it.
#
# THE MEASURED DEFECT: adopt-config's page shipped in v3.8.0 with both of its commands written as
# 'C:/Users/<the author>/.claude/plugins/cache/.../3.8.0/scripts/...'. Wrong for every consumer twice over
# -- a different username, often a different OS -- and pinned to a version that goes stale at the next
# release. It was the newest skill page and the only one of eleven that did not use the substitution, and
# it was the first command a consumer runs to use the release's headline feature.
#
# WHY THE RULE IS ABOUT COMMANDS AND NOT ABOUT PATHS, which is the obvious shape and was measured first: a
# tree-wide "no absolute paths in plugins/" rule is born with THREE findings and all three are correct
# prose -- comments in check-report-lib and check-roster-sync that quote 'C:\Users\x\.claude\...' precisely

# --- 23. a plugin's name says which kind it is, and it must sit where that says ---------------------------
# WHAT THIS CHECK IS FOR, RESTATED (August 26, 2026, issue #886) BECAUSE ITS ORIGINAL REASON EXPIRED.
# From August 9, 2026 the prefix was a MECHANISM: the core team's workflow-sessioncheck decided what
# counted as a workflow by asking whether the plugin's name started with 'workflow-', so a workflow
# named otherwise would never be counted and two could be enabled in silence. That hook and the
# exclusivity rule it enforced were RETIRED with workflow-default, so that argument is gone and is not
# quietly left standing here -- a check whose stated reason no longer holds is worse than one with no
# comment, because the next reader trusts it.
#
# THE TEETH THAT SURVIVE, and they are this check's own. The two halves are not independent: the
# DIRECTORY rule is DERIVED FROM THE NAME. A plugin whose name matches no team or way-of-working shape
# falls through every branch below, so its location is never held against anything -- an unclassifiable
# name does not merely read untidily, it switches this check off for that plugin, silently and for as
# long as nobody counts the Checked total against the published set. That is why the else-branch is an
# error and not a style note, and the reason is now internal to the check rather than borrowed from a
# hook in another plugin.
#
# ANCHORED ON THE PUBLISHED SET, so a directory that is not a plugin is not held to a rule about
# plugins. That is what lets plugins/dkj-teams/agent-shared/ sit beside the teams it feeds without being
# read as a team whose name is missing its 'team-' prefix -- it is in no marketplace, so this loop
# never sees it. Worth knowing before anyone hardens the directory half into a filesystem sweep:
# 'every directory under plugins/dkj-teams/ is named team-*' is a DIFFERENT check from this one, and it
# would be false the moment it was written.

# SEVERAL NAME SHAPES MAP TO THE SAME KIND SINCE AUGUST 26, 2026 (#886), AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
# 'contributing-davekjohn' was renamed from 'workflow-davekjohn' because that is what it does: it serves
# one owner's contributing rules, not a workflow among several. '*-codex' joined the same way on
# September 1, 2026, when 'workflow-bwj' was renamed 'bwj-codex' -- a codex is a body of law, i.e. a way
# of working, and the leading word names whose. '*-policy' / '*-policy-*' joined on September 5, 2026
# (#1437), when 'contributing-davekjohn' became 'dkj-policy' and 'bwj-codex' became 'dkj-policy-bwj':
# a policy IS a way of working, the leading word says whose, and the trailing one -- where there is one --
# says which ministry under it. THE RETIRED SHAPES STAY ACCEPTED rather than being swapped out, which is
# this repo's standing answer to a rename (#952): a consumer who has not migrated still resolves a
# 'contributing-*' plugin, and a check that recognised only today's spelling would report their working
# install as unclassifiable.
#
# THE DIRECTORY NO LONGER NAMES THE KIND, AND ONLY THE POLICY FAMILY HAS A DIRECTORY RULE LEFT
# (#1467, September 5, 2026). plugins/workflows/ used to hold the KIND -- a way of working -- with the
# rest of the name saying whose it is, and Dave kept that directory name through #886 (decision A on that
# issue). #1467 renamed it to plugins/dkj-policy/ and lifted the prime ministry's own files to its root,
# so the directory now names the GOVERNMENT: 'dkj-policy' at plugins\dkj-policy, and every other ministry
# one level inside it ('dkj-policy-bwj' at plugins\dkj-policy\dkj-policy-bwj). That is what the anchored
# '^plugins\\dkj-policy($|\\)' below says, and the '($|\\)' is load-bearing rather than tidy: a bare
# prefix would also accept a sibling directory merely beginning with the same characters, which is a
# different plugin family and not a ministry.
#
# AND THE OTHER THREE SHAPES KEEP THE NAMING HALF ONLY, because there is no directory left to hold them
# to. 'workflow-*' is what a plugin from anybody else would be called, and refusing it would make this
# family's renames somebody else's problem -- but pointing it at plugins/dkj-policy/ would be worse than
# saying nothing: it would order a stranger's workflow into this government. So they fall through with no
# location check, DELIBERATELY, which is a real narrowing of this check and is recorded as one. The
# else-branch below is untouched: a name matching none of the shapes is still an error, because the
# failure it guards -- a plugin silently held to nothing at all -- is the one that has actually happened.
#
# 'team-*' JOINED THAT NAME-ONLY GROUP ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2026 (#1480), and the directory rule moved with the
# teams to 'dkj-team-*' -> plugins\dkj-teams\. The reasoning is the paragraph above applied to the half it
# had not reached yet: once this family's own teams carry the owner prefix, a bare 'team-*' is exactly what
# a team from ANYBODY ELSE is called, and holding it to plugins/dkj-teams/ orders a stranger's team into
# this family's directory -- the same failure the workflow half already refuses to commit. So the shape is
# still recognised as a team by name (an unclassifiable plugin remains an error), and only the location

# --- 24. the PR template keeps the two promises open-pr makes about it ------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS IS FOR, measured at a consumer rather than imagined (#573). open-pr fills the PR body's
# description by comparing each template line, WHOLE AND EXACT, against the recognised placeholders. A
# template one word away from one of them matches nothing, and until August 10, 2026 the run said nothing
# either: that consumer merged TWELVE of sixty PRs with no description at all, found months later by
# diffing their template against this repo's. The warning added that day tells the person running open-pr;
# this check tells the person editing the template, which is one step earlier and one person wider.
#
# TWO SUBJECTS, HELD TO DIFFERENT STRENGTHS ON PURPOSE.
#   * The SHIPPED REFERENCE is held byte for byte to Get-PrTemplateReference. It is not a document anybody
#     edits -- it is the answer this family hands a consumer, and a reference whose placeholder open-pr
#     would walk past is worse than no reference at all, because it arrives looking authoritative. Same
#     reasoning as check 13b for the branch document's reset state and check 21 for the config blueprint.
#   * THIS REPO'S OWN .github/pull_request_template.md is held only to the contract: a placeholder line
#     the matcher recognises. Deliberately weaker, because that file is genuinely repo-owned -- the day it
#     grows a section this repo needs, a byte-for-byte rule would refuse a correct change and the gate
#     would be edited to allow it, which is how a check gets switched off rather than heeded.
#
# THE CONTRACT LOST ITS SECOND HALF ON AUGUST 24, 2026 (issue #865), and the reason is that open-pr stopped
# needing it. It also required A FIRST HEADING, because -RefreshBody replaced the description under the
# template's first heading and a template with none would have degraded to a warning on every run. Since
# #865 that switch reads the PLACEHOLDER's position instead: headings above it are the description's,
# headings below it are the form's boundaries, and where the placeholder comes first the description is the
# body's leading section. So a heading-less template is a supported shape, and this check refusing one
# would now refuse the template this repo actually ships.
#
# A CONSUMER'S TEMPLATE IS NOT CHECKED BY ANYTHING, and that is stated rather than left as a gap: this gate
# runs in this repo. What travels to them is the warning in open-pr and the shipped reference to diff
# against. check-script-contract.ps1 cannot help either -- Get-PrDescriptionPlaceholder is OPTIONAL, so a
# repo that does not define it is correct, exactly the shape recorded for Get-BranchTypes.

# --- 25. the consumer document does not send its reader into a tier written for somebody else -------------
# WHAT THIS IS FOR, and it is measured rather than imagined (August 10, 2026). The tier model gives each
# release document a named reader, and tier 0 -- the changelog notes -- is defined as "only this repo's own
# developers". A link from the consumer document into that tree hands a paying reader the per-PR record and
# calls it theirs. Measured on the day this landed: TWO of eleven consumer documents did exactly that, both
# of them labelling it invitingly -- v4.0.0's "The full recap is in the release notes" and v3.5.0's "Full
# per-change record". Both were removed in the same change, so this check is not born red.
#
# LINKS ONLY, DELIBERATELY. A path mentioned in prose or inline code is check 4's declined territory: this
# repo measured five variants of "a path in backticks must resolve" over 120 documents and the narrowest was
# born with 124 findings, none real, because most paths this product names describe somebody ELSE's repo. A
# markdown LINK escapes that entirely -- it is not a path being discussed, it is a destination being offered,
# and whose repo it is in is no longer ambiguous.
#
# TWO RULES WERE MEASURED ALONGSIDE THIS ONE AND BOTH DECLINED, recorded here because the next person to
# have the idea should not have to re-measure it:
#   * "no significance score in a consumer document" -- 4 findings, ALL FALSE. v3.7.0's release was ABOUT
#     the entry format, so its consumer document correctly quotes '#### Tier 2' and '**Score:** N/A' as
#     illustrations of the shape it is announcing. The generator already strips real scores
#     (-StripSignificance, asserted in release-lib.tests.ps1); what a human adds afterwards is prose.
#   * "no branch name or PR number in a consumer document" -- 3 findings, ALL FALSE, and the same reason:
#     '## `feat/your-branch` changelog' is v3.7.0 showing the reader the new heading.
# Both would have needed an exemption list on the day they landed, which is the shape this repo has already
# been bitten by. The rest of the writing norm therefore travels as PROSE in the cut-release skill, where a
# person applies it, rather than as gates that cannot tell an illustration from a leak.
#
# MORE THAN ONE TREE SINCE AUGUST 10, 2026, and the reason they are all read is that some of them are
# ARCHIVES. The two hand-written documents became one -- the tree Get-ReleaseNoteRoot names, since August 12
# releases/audience/, with a named section per reader -- and the
# rule follows the reader rather than the directory: a consumer reads the whole of that file, organisation
# section included, so a link into the per-PR record is exactly as wrong there as it was before.
#
# THIS REPO'S OWN ARCHIVE IS GONE AND 'releases\consumer' IS STILL READ, which is the point of the list
# rather than an oversight (August 12, 2026). Dave had the twelve releases/consumer/ + releases/internal/
# pairs merged into releases/audience/, so this repo has one hand-written tree and nothing else -- but a
# CONSUMER on the two-document flow still has that directory, and they receive this gate through a plugin
# update rather than by choosing to. Dropping the name would silently stop holding their outward-facing
# documents, with a coverage count that still looked healthy. Reading a root that is not there costs
# nothing: absent roots are filtered out below. Recognise both, write one.
#
# 'releases\internal' is deliberately NOT in the list, and that is not symmetry being broken by accident:
# this check asks whether a document written for a CONSUMER offers them a link into somewhere written for
# somebody else. An internal note's reader IS the organisation, so reading that tree here would accuse a
# correct document of the thing it cannot commit. The merged document is covered because its consumer
# section and its organisational sections share one file, which the reader-not-directory rule already
# handles -- not because both trees are scanned.

# THE LIVE ROOT COMES FROM THE SEAM, and that is a repair rather than a flourish (August 12, 2026). This

# gate would have found no live tree, checked the archive alone, and reported a coverage count that still
# looked healthy -- a gate going quiet with nothing erroring, which is the failure class this repo keeps
# paying for. script-contract-lib.ps1 states the same lesson at this very seam's record, about its

# --- 26. no frontmatter-bearing shipped document carries a byte-order mark --------------------------------
# READ AS BYTES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every other reader in this gate goes through
# [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText(..., UTF8), which DETECTS AND STRIPS a BOM before any regex sees it -- so a
# BOM is invisible to all twenty-five checks above, to the canonical-skillset reader that takes each skill's
# name from '(?m)^name:', and to every editor a reviewer would open the file in. It is the one defect
# findable by neither reading nor this gate, and the first three bytes are the only vantage point from which
# it exists at all.
#
# A REPAIR, NOT A PRECAUTION. plugins/dkj-policy/skills/adopt-config/SKILL.md shipped with
# EF BB BF in 4.1.0 -- the only one of the eleven skills across the two shipped plugins to carry it, and the
# only model-invocable one absent from the agent's skill listing. A frontmatter parser that wants '---' at
# offset 0 sees a BOM in front of it and reads the file as having no frontmatter, so the skill has no name
# and never registers. Nothing errors; the page is simply not there. It bites the consumer who can least
# afford it -- a fresh one, whose seam adopt-config exists to fill, and who cannot tell a skill that failed
# to load from one deliberately hidden behind disable-model-invocation. Reported as #581 from
# BWJ-ecommerce/smartwatchbanden, who found it by diffing first bytes because reading cannot.
# (Described in words rather than quoted: a literal BOM in the sentence explaining the bug is invisible here
# too, which is how one got into this very comment on the first draft.)
#
# THE SET IS EVERY FRONTMATTER-BEARING SHIPPED DOCUMENT, not only SKILL.md -- an agent def, manual or
# persona whose frontmatter the harness parses for 'name:'/'id:'/'group:' breaks identically and just as
# quietly, and checks 3/3b/3c already enumerate three of the four sets. Measured before widening rather than
# assumed: 69 documents (26 agent defs, 26 manuals, 4 personas, 13 registered skill pages), all four sets
# non-empty, ZERO findings once the one BOM was stripped, zero exemptions. A check needing an exemption list
# on its first run is the shape this repo has scar tissue from; this one is born green, and reintroducing
# the byte was used to prove it fires rather than merely passes.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS THE BOM AND NOT "MUST HAVE FRONTMATTER", and that narrowing was forced by measurement. The
# first draft also reported a file not opening with '---' at all, which reads as the same defect and is not:
# this repo DELIBERATELY tolerates a skill page without the line -- the canonical reader above falls back to
# the folder name precisely "so a future skill without that line does not silently drop out". Demanding the
# block would be this gate inventing a policy the repo declined, and it showed up at once, because the lint
# suite's own minimal fixtures for checks 18 and 22 are frontmatter-less on purpose: the rule was born with
# two findings, both false, and quieting them meant shifting the line numbers check 22 asserts on.
#
# A BOM needs no such policy -- it is never intentional in any of these files and always breaks a positional
# parse where frontmatter is present. A stray blank line above the block is a real but UNMEASURED cousin:
# named here and deliberately not guarded, per the standing rule that a risk which has not bitten gets

# --- 27. the script layer is pure ASCII ------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE RULE ALREADY EXISTED AND NOTHING ENFORCED IT. .claude/rules/language-layers.md has said "the script
# layer is ASCII, and a character the script must EMIT is written as a code point" since August 19, 2026,
# and every .ps1 in this tree closes its own docstring with "Pure ASCII (repo convention for .ps1)". A
# convention held up by whoever remembers it is the shape this repo keeps paying for; this is the check.
#
# THE MEASURED DAMAGE, and it is not a style complaint. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less .ps1 as
# the SYSTEM ANSI CODE PAGE, so the two UTF-8 bytes of a middot (U+00B7) are decoded as two CP1252
# characters -- and nothing errors, because a mis-decoded string is still a string. On August 19, 2026 a
# middot typed literally into scripts/lib/entry-scaffold-lib.ps1 came out of EVERY generated changelog
# template as two wrong characters, and it reached the author's entry before anyone saw it. The repair is
# the code point ([char]0x00B7), not a BOM: the shared libs are held byte-identical to their plugin
# mirrors by check 8, so an encoding change would have to land in both, while an escape keeps the file
# out of the question entirely.
#
# WHY THIS AND NOT THE MOJIBAKE CHECK ABOVE. Check 14 hunts damage that has ALREADY happened, and its set
# (Get-MojibakePaths) is markdown -- so it sees the mangled character one layer downstream, in the
# generated document, after it has been copied into somebody's entry. This check sees the literal upstream,
# in the source that will emit it, which is the only place a repair is cheap.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS THE CHARACTER, NOT THE ENCODING. A BOM is deliberately NOT a finding here: on a .ps1 it
# is the one thing that makes 5.1 read the file correctly, so flagging it would push authors toward the
# defect. ReadAllText strips it before the scan for that reason, and check 26 owns the documents where a
# BOM does break something. Invalid UTF-8 is caught anyway -- it decodes to U+FFFD, which is non-ASCII.
#
# BORN GREEN, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN: 158 tracked .ps1 files, all of them inside this set once
# the plugin hooks were added to it, and exactly two carrying a non-ASCII character --
# scripts/lib/pr-issues-lib.ps1 and its plugin mirror, two lines each, a deliberate en/em dash inside a
# regex character class. Both were repaired on this branch (composed from [char] code points) rather than
# exempted, and no exemption list exists. A check needing one on its first run is the shape this repo has

# --- 28. every '@'-import target resolves -----------------------------------------------------------------
# THE CLASS CHECK 4 CANNOT SEE. The [link] check above validates '[text](target)' and nothing else, so an
# '@'-import -- a different syntax entirely -- matches none of it. Reported as issue #874.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT JUST ANOTHER DEAD LINK. A dead markdown link costs a reader one click. A dead '@'-import
# costs the SESSION THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, silently: Claude Code drops an import it cannot resolve, nothing
# errors, and the instructions simply are not there. The failure is asymmetric in the worst direction,
# because the always-on path of this repo is assembled entirely out of imports and the layer that would
# vanish is the one carrying the safety rules or the roster. The only symptom is a session behaving as
# if it had never read them.
#
# THE THREE RESOLUTION RULES ARE NOT RESTATED HERE. measure-context-lib.ps1 already implements and
# documents them ('~/' -> user home, rooted -> as given, otherwise -> relative to the IMPORTING FILE's
# own directory, which is not the repo root), and its suite pins them. This check reuses that parser,
# so the gate and the measurement script cannot drift on what an import means. The issue proposed
# restating the rules; reusing them is the same repair with one definition instead of two.
#
# TWO DISCRIMINATORS, BOTH MEASURED BEFORE THIS WAS WRITTEN. A '^@' sweep of every markdown file in the
# tree returns 12 lines and only 3 are imports:
#   - 7 are PowerShell '@(...)' expressions inside fenced blocks. Fences are tracked, exactly as check 4
#     argues for links: illustrating a thing is not doing it.
#   - 1 is PROSE -- dkj-policy/releases/changelog/1.x/1.16.0.md, a paragraph that happens to wrap onto
#     '@-imported here (this maintenance repo ...)'. Get-ImportLinePath takes the rest of the line as the
#     path, which is right for the always-on walk (it never meets prose) and wrong for a scan set that
#     includes archived release notes. A target containing WHITESPACE is therefore not an import here.
#     That is a discriminator rather than an exemption list, deliberately: a check born needing one is
#     the shape this repo has scar tissue from (see check 27).
#
# AN IMPORT OUTSIDE THE REPO IS COUNTED, NOT REFUSED. SPECIALISTS.md imports the orchestrator's persona
# from the plugin MARKETPLACE CLONE under '~/', which legitimately does not exist on a machine without
# that plugin installed. CI is such a machine, so erroring there would fail every PR for a correct file.
# The coverage line names how many were seen instead.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT, because it has not bitten. The mirror image of the prose rule: a
# wrapped paragraph beginning '@' at column 0 INSIDE an always-on document would be read by Claude Code
# as an import, and the document after it lost. No instance exists -- the only prose line in the tree
# sits in an archived release note nothing loads -- and .claude/rules/language-layers.md's standing rule
# is that a risk which has not bitten is written down rather than built against. This comment is that
# writing-down.

# --- 29. a plugin's OWN skill enumeration, scoped to that plugin and read from its links ------------------
# THE HALF CHECK 10 CANNOT HOLD, split out of #873 and measured in #920. Check 10 exists for a document
# that claims to list EVERY skill in the marketplace, and both of its defining properties make it the
# wrong instrument for a document that claims to list every skill of ONE plugin:
#
#   * its canonical set is repo-wide -- built from Get-PluginSubdirs over every published plugin -- so a
#     span in plugins/dkj-policy/README.md, which enumerates the 16 that plugin
#     ships, would report the team plugins' skills as 'missing';
#   * every backtick-quoted token inside its span is a claimed name, which is why its own author
#     condition is 'wrap tightly'. That table is two columns and three of its rows carry a backticked
#     path or flag in the SECOND one -- so the span could not close around only the names without
#     making the prose worse in order to satisfy a checker.
#
# So this is a second, separately opt-in sentinel rather than a relaxation of check 10. It differs in
# exactly those two respects and in nothing else: same fence masking, same unpaired-marker errors, same
# symmetric END sweep, same silent pass on zero spans.
#
#   1. SCOPE. The plugin is resolved from the FILE'S OWN PATH, through Get-PluginNameForPath -- the same
#      function the fold uses to decide which plugins a PR touched. A span in a file under no plugin root
#      is a hard error rather than a silent skip: the marker's whole meaning is 'this plugin', and a file
#      that belongs to none has made a claim nothing can adjudicate.
#   2. THE CLAIM IS THE LINK, NOT THE BACKTICKS. Every markdown link inside the span whose target
#      resolves to <this plugin>/skills/<one>/SKILL.md is one claimed skill; everything else inside the
#      span -- prose, backticked paths, flags, links elsewhere -- is ignored. That is what lets a
#      two-column table with running prose in the second column be marked without rewriting it, and it
#      needs no author condition at all. Resolution is relative to the document's own directory, exactly
#      as check 4 resolves a relative link.
#
# EXACTLY ONE segment between 'skills' and 'SKILL.md', mirroring check 10's canonical walk: a level-3
# progressive-disclosure page at skills/<name>/references/SKILL.md is not a top-level skill and is not
# read as a claim.
#
# THE COMPARISON IS ON FOLDER NAMES, where check 10 compares frontmatter 'name:' values. A link target
# can only ever name a DIRECTORY, so the directory is the only thing this span is able to claim. Should
# a skill's folder ever diverge from its frontmatter name, that divergence is check 3's domain, not
# this one's, and this check keeps answering the question it can actually answer: does the table link
# to every skill directory this plugin ships, and to nothing else.
#
# WHY IT MUST STAY OPT-IN, measured across all four plugins before it was proposed (#920): a generic
# rule -- 'a plugin README lists every skill it ships' -- would be born needing an exemption list.
# dkj-policy ships 16 and lists 16; dkj-team-alpha ships 4 and lists 0; dkj-team-shopify ships 4
# and lists 0; dkj-team-ecomm ships 0. So a non-opt-in version produces 8 findings on two documents that
# never claimed to enumerate anything, which is the shape this repo has scar tissue from (check 10's
# own prose scan rejected at 147 hits, the stale-path check declined at 124, check 27's exemption
# argument). An explicit sentinel fires on exactly the one table that means it.
#
# THE RECURRENCE THIS CLOSES: that table's correctness was guarded only by 'count when you add one',
# which has failed three times -- nine/twelve, thirteen/fourteen, fourteen/sixteen.
#
# BORN GREEN: 1 span, 16 claimed, 16 canonical, 0 findings at introduction.

# --- 30. A plugin-shipped relative link must resolve INSIDE its own plugin ---------------------------
#
# WHY CHECK 4 CANNOT SEE THIS, AND IS RIGHT NOT TO. The dead-link scan resolves every link against the
# tree it is run in, and for a plugin-shipped file that tree is the source repo -- the one place the
# link is guaranteed to work. It is correct about where the file IS; it has no notion of where the file
# will be READ. So the single class of link defect that reaches consumers is the one class it is
# structurally blind to. Inbound #1066, August 29, 2026.
#
# WHERE A CONSUMER ACTUALLY READS IT, measured rather than assumed -- this is the whole check:
#
#     ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/
#
# Every installPath in installed_plugins.json is that shape. The plugin's OWN directory is the root,
# and three things present in the source tree are gone from it: the 'plugins/' level, the family level
# ('teams/', 'workflows/'), and every sibling plugin -- each sibling is a separate versioned directory,
# not a neighbour. A relative link that walks out of the plugin root therefore lands somewhere that
# does not exist, or worse, somewhere that does and holds something else.
#
# THE BOUNDARY IS THE PLUGIN ROOT, NOT 'plugins/', and that distinction is the reason this check is
# worth having rather than a detail of it. #1066 proposed the rule as "must resolve to a target also
# under plugins/, because that is the subtree the plugin cache contains". The cache contains no such
# subtree, and the weaker rule passes the one link that had ALREADY SHIPPED dead: cut-release's
# SKILL.md line 123 pointed at '../../../../teams/team-alpha/manuals/06-25-manual.md', which stays
# under plugins/ here and resolves to '<cache>/<marketplace>/teams/team-alpha/...' in a consumer,
# where the family level does not exist. Verified against the installed v4.22.0 copy on disk, not
# inferred. The manual it names does travel -- it simply never travels to that path.
#
# THE SIZE, RECOUNTED. #1066 reported zero findings and argued from that ("today's expected answer is
# zero, which is itself the reason not to build it yet"), and added that the defect "never shipped".
# The real count on the day the check landed was 17 escapes across 5 files, every one passing check 4 --
# and resolving all 17 inside the INSTALLED copies (dkj-team-alpha 4.21.0, dkj-policy 4.22.0)
# rather than in this tree, all 17 are dead. Not one of them, all of them. That inverts the report's own
# conclusion instead of qualifying it: the failure mode has bitten, in released payload, so the repo's
# name-it-and-leave-it rule no longer holds it back.
#
# THE CONVENTION THIS ENFORCES IS ALREADY WRITTEN, in DEVELOPMENT-portable.md: "links into the source's
# script tree are absolute on purpose". It was stated on one portable page, for that page, and enforced
# nowhere. This is that sentence made checkable for the plugin tree as a whole.
#
# PERSONAS ARE EXCLUDED, for check 4's reason and not a new one: a persona template is destined for a
# consuming repo's .claude/extensions/, so its links are MEANT to resolve outside the plugin root and
# check 4 already validates them at that destination. Measured when this check was written: no persona
# carries an escaping link either way, so the exclusion buys correctness rather than silence.
#
# THREE FORMS ARE PASSED OVER, each for its own reason: a '${...}' target is the plugin-relative form
# (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}) rather than a path this check can resolve; a '~/'-relative one points into
# the marketplace clone deliberately; an absolute URL is the repair this check asks for.
#
# A FOURTH, ROOT-RELATIVE FORM ('/path') IS PASSED OVER TOO, and that one is a risk named rather than
# handled. On GitHub it means the repo root; in a plugin cache it means the filesystem root, so it is a
# defect of the same family. Measured when this check landed: ZERO of them in plugin payload. The repo's
# standing rule is to name a risk that has not bitten and leave it, so this stays a comment -- but it is
# a comment rather than an omission, and the second instance is the argument for widening the rule.

# --- 30. printed instructions naming a model-barred skill -------------------------------------------
# A PRINTED INSTRUCTION MUST NOT TELL ITS READER TO "RUN THE X SKILL" WHEN X IS BARRED TO THAT READER.
# A skill whose frontmatter carries 'disable-model-invocation: true' has its page removed from the
# model's context entirely, so a session cannot see it and will not invoke it. A message that says
# `run the 'cut-release' skill` therefore names a route its reader does not have -- and the reader who
# DOES have it, the person at the keyboard, is never told they are the one who has to type it. The
# correct form names the slash-command and the actor, or names the script directly: the flag decides
# WHO TYPES THE LINE, not whether the line may run (new-branch/SKILL.md states this in full).
#
# WHY A CHECK RATHER THAN CARE -- the class bit twice, a month apart, and nothing connected the two:
# #731 -> #734 repaired it for the shipping chain, and #1093/#1096 rediscovered the same defect from
# scratch on the adoption path, where a consumer adoption stopped on it (testrun-2, August 29, 2026).
# Both repairs are wording, in files nothing holds to a shape, so a third instance is one message away.
# Offered as optional by #1093 and deliberately NOT built there, under this repo's rule that a risk
# which has not bitten gets named rather than repaired; filed as #1104 once the second instance made it
# a class rather than a risk.
#
# IT IS FRONTMATTER-DRIVEN, NOT A PHRASING RULE, and that is what keeps it honest. check-script-contract
# names 'adopt-dkj-policy' with exactly this bare imperative and is CORRECT to: that skill carries
# no flag, so its page is in context and a session can invoke it. A grep for "run the '...' skill" would
# have been born with that false finding. Only the barred set below is a subject.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE WORD 'skill' AFTER THE NAME, and it was measured rather than assumed. Without
# it -- an imperative verb plus a barred name anywhere in the message -- the scan returns 8 unique sites
# of which 4 are wrong: three name the SCRIPT rather than the skill ("run scripts/maintenance/
# fix-mojibake.ps1 to repair", "then run ship-pr again", "run park-cycle by hand" -- that last one a
# substring of the barred name 'park'), and one is prose offering a choice rather than issuing an
# instruction. With the discriminator: 11 hits over 7 unique sites, all 7 correct. That is the same
# mention-versus-use separation check 11 makes with its @-target, and it is what makes a generic scan
# viable here where check 10 had to be opt-in.
#
# THE SUBJECT IS BOTH LAYERS, also measured. Printed script output carries 6 of the 7 sites; INSTALL.md
# carries the seventh, in a consumer-facing document. Output-only would have shipped a check that passes
# over the one instance a consumer actually reads.
#
# PRINTED means a string argument to a writer cmdlet, found through the PowerShell PARSER rather than by
# line matching -- so a comment explaining the rule (this one included) is not a subject, and neither is
# a variable name. Markdown is matched per line, where there is no such distinction to draw.
#
# NOT SKIPPABLE, deliberately: -SkipCheck's list is the three checks the gate's own suites need, and the
# comment on $script:SkippableChecks says adding a fourth is a deliberate act. This one does not reuse
# check 5's pass, which is what lets it run when 'parse' is skipped -- it takes its CommandAsts from
# Get-PsScriptCommandAsts, shared with the equally non-skippable shopify-cli check below (issue #1358).
# Both used to parse and walk the same file set separately; that accessor's comment holds the measurement.

#
#     & shopify theme pull --store $store --theme $liveId --path $mirror
#     if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { <clean up; report; exit 1> }
#
# dies on the line AFTER the call the moment the CLI writes anything to stderr, so the exit-code check
# below it never runs. The repair is scripts/lib/shopify-cli-lib.ps1, which lowers the preference for
# the duration of the call; the reason it needs a gate is that THE DANGEROUS FORM IS THE ABSENCE OF A
# WRAPPER. There is no redirect to grep for and no suspicious flag -- the wrong spelling is the shorter,
# more obvious one, which is exactly how the four sites this check was written for came to exist.
#
# ONE EXEMPTION, AND IT IS THE WRAPPER ITSELF, matched on its path so its plugin mirror is exempt too.
# Anything else naming 'shopify' as a command is a finding, including a new script in a plugin that does
# not exist yet: a consumer receives whatever ships, and a second wrapper is the same defect twice.
#
# THROUGH THE PARSER, NOT BY LINE MATCHING, for the reason check 30 gives: a comment explaining the rule
# (this one included) mentions the command, and so does every printed hint that tells a reader to run
# 'shopify theme list'. Only a CommandAst is a call. NOT SKIPPABLE, like every check added since the
# -SkipCheck list was fixed at the three the gate's own suites need -- and because both this check and
# check 30 always run, the two share ONE parse and ONE walk of the script set through
# Get-PsScriptCommandAsts (issue #1358) instead of each doing their own.
# TWO EXEMPTIONS, BOTH BY FILE NAME AND BOTH ABOUT THE SAME ONE CALL. The wrapper holds the permitted
# call, and shopify-cli.tests.ps1 holds the assert that gives the wrapper its meaning: it invokes the
# stub BARE, on purpose, to read back that the shim inherits the caller's 'Stop' -- which is what makes
# the neighbouring 'Continue' assert prove anything. Matched on the name rather than a full path, so a
# plugin mirror of either is exempt too; check 8 already holds a mirror byte-identical to its source.
# The gate found the test's own probe the first time it ran, which is how the second name got here.

# --- 32. a mirror table's rows against the shared-scripts registry ----------------------------------------
# THE FOURTH OCCURRENCE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT (issue #1491). plugins/dkj-policy/scripts/README.md holds
# a hand-written table of the shared scripts that land in that plugin, beside Get-SharedScriptPairs, which
# can simply be asked. It has gone stale against that registry three times: August 15, 2026 (three rows
# missing -- adopt-workflow-folder, session-status, source-repo-guard-lib), August 26, 2026 (the header,
# the destination split and the row list all wrong at once), and September 6, 2026 (#1486: 21 rows short of
# a 45-entry registry). Each repair was a hand pass, which resets the clock rather than stopping it.
#
# CHECK 8 IS NOT THIS, and the distinction is the whole reason a second check is needed. Check 8 holds each
# mirror's CONTENT against its source -- it proves the file on disk is the right file. Nothing before this
# asked whether the page that TELLS a consumer which files exist still names them all, so a script could be
# registered, generated, mirrored byte-perfect and pass every gate while being invisible on the one page a
# consumer reads. All three misses above were of exactly that shape.
#
# THE SCOPE IS THE DOCUMENT'S OWN DIRECTORY, not "this plugin". The canonical set is every registry mirror
# that lands at or below the folder the marked document sits in, relativized against that folder -- which
# is what makes the claims in the table (`task/new-branch.ps1`) comparable as written. Put the marker in
# plugins/<p>/scripts/README.md and it means that folder; put it in plugins/<p>/README.md and it means the
# whole plugin, with the deeper paths (`scripts/task/new-branch.ps1`) the table would then have to carry.
# A file under no published plugin is a hard error rather than a silent skip, exactly as in check 29: the
# marker's meaning is "the mirrors that land here", and a document outside the tree has made a claim
# nothing can adjudicate.
#
# THE CLAIM IS THE ROW'S FIRST CELL, and this is where it differs from both siblings. Check 10 reads every
# backtick pair in the span; check 29 reads link targets. Neither serves a three-column table whose second
# column is running prose carrying `-Worker`, `Get-LintScript`, `Invoke-GitPark` and `CHANGELOG.md`, and
# whose third is a link to a SKILL.md rather than to the script. The first cell IS the claim this table
# makes -- its header says 'Script' -- so that is what is read: the first backticked token of the first
# cell of every table row inside the span. A header row ('Script'), a separator ('---') and a prose line
# carry no backticked first cell and are passed over without a rule of their own.
#
# WHY OPT-IN, like both siblings and for the third time in this file. A blanket rule -- "a plugin's
# scripts/README.md lists every mirror" -- would need an allow-list on the day it was written: the ROOT
# scripts/README.md is a deliberate SUBSET of the same registry (only what a person invokes by hand, as
# its own text says), so a check keyed on filename would false-positive on every lib, hook-only script and
# generator there. That page keeps its own question open; #1491 says so explicitly, and the sentinel is
# what lets this one be gated without answering it. Same scar tissue as check 10's prose scan (rejected at
# 147 hits) and the stale-path check (declined at 124, all false).
#
